When I started college, I explored a lot of things with my closest friends, which we really needed as one of my friends had to study in the province. We made sure that our plans are memorable as we take our own paths.

As of now, I’m still adapting to my surroundings because I wasn’t used to it though I really enjoy the companions I get and friends that I made in this time. They became my motivation in this course even though we’re not that many but it really shows that they'll be there to support you. I even made a trio wherein I really love being with them as I felt I wasn’t alone taking this path.
